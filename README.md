# PyGameProjects
This Repository will contain games written in Python

To all interested contributors ::
If you need to do change please feel free to do and any feedback and feature changes are welcome.
This is my first project. My coding skills might be little shaky. Please feel free to contact for any clarifications.
Any more details if needed do contact.


Current Features of the game ::
1) It follows the basic rules as normal TicTacToe Game.
2) For now the game can be played between two players only


Features needed to change ::
1) After game finishes it waites for 3 seconds to start a new game. The feature which I need to be added is that after the game finished there should come one button with text "Restart Game". When user clicks the button then the Game should Restart.
2) If Cross or Round wins then an appropriate message should come up so that it becomes user interactive.
3) Game should have to options :: 
    i)  Play with Computer
    ii) Play with other Players offline
    

Future plans::
As of no plans yet.
